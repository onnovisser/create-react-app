# cst-react-scripts

Custom changes to `react-scripts`. This is unlikely to work for you and you'd probably want to use `react-scripts` instead.

This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
Please refer to its documentation:
